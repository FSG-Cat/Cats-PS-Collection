To use the APB Config tool you simply need to have the ability to run scripts and extract a copy of Flaws Config v20 into a directory called config in the same folder as the script is going to be run from. 

Getting a copy of these files is a lesson for the reader but the usual source is the Descript on Twitch for Flaws. 

NOTE: CONFIG TOOL IS CURRENTLY NOT UPDATED TO LATEST APB VERSIONS. Its fixable yes but as i dont play the game actively currently i havent fixed it.
